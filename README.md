Audio signal processing is a subfield of signal processing that is concerned with the electronic manipulation of audio signals. The project, based on Signal Processing, employs sound as a signal and demonstrates various functionalities that can be performed on it. Further, it simulates complex real-world applications of sound wave/audio by assuming a simpler scenario. These functionalities are made possible with a convenient programming language Python and Spyder Integrated Development Environment (IDE). 

A list of channels containing different options available for broadcasting is presented to the user. These options on the list consist of a set of sound processing functionalities. These functionalities include basic operations such as reading, recording, and generating a sound file. Further, sound signals are incorporated in our application-based algorithm to demonstrate a real-world scenario. 

The next part of our project consists of an application-based technique in which radio communication and broadcasting are simulated. The following operations have been performed to simulate radio broadcasting:
  1. Frequency Modulation and Demodulation
  2. Amplitude Modulation
  3. Design and Analyse Filters
  4. Noise Compression
